Certainly! Below is an example of how to implement binary search in Rust. This implementation assumes that the input slice is sorted.

```rust
fn binary_search<T: Ord>(arr: &[T], target: T) -> Option<usize> {
    let mut left = 0;
    let mut right = arr.len();

    while left < right {
        let mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

        if arr[mid] == target {
            return Some(mid);
        } else if arr[mid] < target {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    None // Target not found
}
    
fn main() {
    let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    let target = 5;

    match binary_search(&arr, target) {
        Some(index) => println!("Found {} at index {}", target, index),
        None => println!("{} not found in the array", target),
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Function Definition**: The `binary_search` function takes a slice of elements (`arr`) and a `target` value to search for. The type `T` must implement the `Ord` trait, which allows for comparisons.
  
2. **Variables**: `left` and `right` are initialized to represent the bounds of the search range. `right` is set to the length of the array.

3. **Loop**: The loop continues until `left` is less than `right`. The midpoint (`mid`) is calculated, and the value at this index is compared to the target:
   - If the value is equal to the target, the index is returned.
   - If the value is less than the target, the search range is adjusted to the right half.
   - If the value is greater than the target, the search range is adjusted to the left half.

4. **Return Value**: If the target is not found, the function returns `None`.

5. **Main Function**: An example array is defined, and the `binary_search` function is called with a target value. The result is printed to the console.

### Usage:
To run this code, you can create a new Rust project using Cargo, add this code to the `main.rs` file, and then run the project. If you have any questions or need further modifications, feel free to ask!
