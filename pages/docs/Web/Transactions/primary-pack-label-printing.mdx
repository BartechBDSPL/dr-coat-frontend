## 3. View Table of Quantities and Labels

- **Step 3.1:** Below the fields, a table will be displayed with the following values:
  - **Target Quantity**
  - **PAL**
  - **ZPE**
  - **Printed Label** (initially set to 0)
  - **Remaining Labels**

- **Step 3.2:** The **Remaining Labels** are calculated by dividing the **Target Quantity** by the **ZPE** value.

  For example:
  - **Target Quantity:** 1,150,000
  - **ZPE Value:** 800
  - **Remaining Labels:** `1150000 / 800 = 1438` (displayed as 688 Remaining Labels and 750 Printed Labels)

## 4. Print Quantity Input and Validation

- **Step 4.1:** Below the table, an input field for **PrintQty** is provided, where the user can enter the quantity they wish to print.
